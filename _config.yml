about_content: >
  I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://mo.kaist.ac.kr/en/">the CCS Graduate School of Mobility, KAIST,</a>
  specializing in <mark>the optimal design of electric vehicle components using deep learning and multi-physics simulations.</mark>
  My research spans topics such as metasurface design for electromagnetic wave absorption 
  and cooling channel optimization for EV batteries, combining physics-based modeling and machine learning techniques.
  With a strong academic foundationâ€”M.S. in Physics from UNIST and B.S. in Physics from Pusan National University.
  My previous work includes FDTD simulations, genetic algorithms, and the development of deep learning frameworks for physical systems.
  Outside of academia, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems in mobility and materials science.
