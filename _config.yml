about_content: >
  I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://mo.kaist.ac.kr/en/">the CCS Graduate School of Mobility, KAIST</a>, focusing on <strong>the optimal design of electric vehicle components using deep learning and multi-physics simulations.</strong>
  My research combines physics-based modeling with deep learning techniques, leveraging state-of-the-art models. I have a strong background in physics, having earned an M.S. in Physics from UNIST and a B.S. in Physics from Pusan National University.
  My previous work includes FDTD simulations, genetic algorithms, and the development of deep learning frameworks for physical systems, primarily applied to military technologies.
  I am driven by a passion for advancing technology to address real-world challenges, particularly through innovative deep learning methodologies.
